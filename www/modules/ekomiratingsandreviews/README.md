# eKomi Ratings and Reviews Plugin for Prestashop 

Ekomi is the leading third-party review service, specializing in the collection, management and publishing of seller and product ratings for businesses. Thanks to our constant innovation and market-leading technology, we offer the most flexible review generation methods, allowing you to reach all your clients, both online and offline to request their feedback. The more ratings you get for your business, the more traffic you drive to your site, the more trust you create among current and potential clients, and the more you will boost your sales and ROI.

With our official eKomi Plugin for Prestashop you can now seamlessly integrate our eKomi review collection and display technology with your shop system and website. Automatically trigger the sending of a review request the moment an order has reached a predefined stat	us, and display any product reviews received automatically on the corresponding product pages with our review container. This allows you to generate and display genuine client reviews, all while we syndicate your seller ratings to Google, Bing and Yahoo.
Please note that you will need an eKomi account to use the plugin, and our standard packages start at $49 monthly. For a live demonstration of our product, feel free to book your most convenient time slot here, or alternatively email us at support@ekomi.de.
